 * combat_submarine.h - a submarine used for operational missions

 * current mission plus a history of past missions.
 *
 * linkedSubmarines_ holds raw, non-owning pointers -- same reasoning
 * as Message::sender_ (submarine.h/message.h): the fleet manager owns
 * every submarine; this is purely "who else is on this mission,"
 * never a claim on their lifetime.
