 * hand. A real IR remote transmission is a dense burst (a full NEC
 * frame produces 60+ edges within ~67ms); ambient/electrical noise is
 * assumed sparser. Instead of treating the very first edge as a
 * detection, require at least BURST_THRESHOLD edges within
 * BURST_WINDOW_MS of each other before accepting it as real.
 *
 * Empirically tuned from hardware logs (2026-09-06): routine SD-write
 * noise typically produces ~8-14 accepted edges per write, but has been
 * observed spiking to 21 on at least one occasion (a threshold of 20
 * was too tight a margin above that and let it through as a false
 * detection -- confirmed by burst_edge_count printing exactly 21 at the
 * moment of that false trigger). A real remote click produces 200+. 50
 * sits with a much wider margin above the observed noise ceiling and
 * still well below the signal floor. Re-tune both if noise still gets
 * through, or if a genuine press stops being recognized -- this is a
 * heuristic, not a real protocol decode, so it's not guaranteed against
 * noise that happens to also be bursty. */

 * faster than MIN_EDGE_SPACING_US after the previous one physically
 * cannot be a real demodulated IR transition -- reject it outright,
