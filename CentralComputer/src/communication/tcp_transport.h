/*
 * tcp_transport.h - Transport implementation over a TCP client socket.
 *
 * Used when Ethernet is the chosen transport, in place of
 * SerialTransport -- see CLAUDE.md's "Ethernet-simulation gateway" note.
 * Connects to the gateway (the TCP server; this class is always the
 * client) at construction, RAII-style like SerialPort: constructor
 * connects, destructor closes, no separate open()/close() to remember.
 *
 * Knows nothing about TLV, messages, or commands -- same as SerialPort,
 * it only moves bytes.
